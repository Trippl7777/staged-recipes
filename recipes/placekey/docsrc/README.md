# placekey-py documentation

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is used to auto-generate documentation for this library. The source for the documentation is in ./docsrc/. A test build of the documentation can be generated by running

```shell script
make clean; make html
```

in `./docsrc`, and the documentation will be generated in `./docsrc/build`.

To build the documentation for hosting on Github Pages run

```shell script
make clean; make github
```

which will generate the documentation and move it to `./docs`.
